abstract: The basic concepts of category theory are developed and examples of them are presented to illustrate them using measurement theory and probability theory tools. Motivated by Perroneâ€™s work  where notes on category theory are developed with examples of basic mathematics, we present the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and products with examples in the probabilistic context.
