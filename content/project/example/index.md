The basic concepts of category theory are developed and examples of them are presented to illustrate them using measurement theory and probability theory tools.
Motivated by Perrone’s work  where notes on category theory are developed with examples of basic mathematics, we present the concepts of category, functor, natural
transformation, and products with examples in the probabilistic context.


The most prominent examples of the application of Category Theory to Probability Theory are the Lawvere and Giry approaches. However, there are few categories with objects as probability spaces due to the difficulty of finding an appropriate condition to define arrows between them.
